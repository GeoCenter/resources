title: Bar Graphs in Excel

### Description
[Bar Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map) are an effective visualization for comparing values across groups or categories. Bar graphs present grouped data as rectangular bars, where the length of each bar is proportion to the underlying data. In the tutorial below, we will demonstrate how to create a rotated, sorted bar graph.

### Example

### Encoding
**x**: categorical

**y**: numeric

**color** (fill): numeric or categorical

### How does the data need to be formatted?  
A simple data table is necessary for a bar graph. Data can be in a long or wide format in Excel.

### Excel version
Excel 2010 for Windows

### Instructions
1. Highlight the cell values that you wish to graph.
2. On the Excel ribbon, navigate to the ```Insert``` tab and select the ```See all charts``` option. This will launch a new window with all of the graphing options. Select the bar graph option from the Insert Chart menu.

After clicking OK, you should see a similar graph in your Excel workbook.

3. __Sort that data__: First, let's sort the data from the largest to the smallest value. We will also reverse the values so that the largest value appears at the top of the graphic. To sort your data, navigate to the Home tab on the ribbon and select the custom sort option from the drop down menu. Select your desired columns over which you would like to sort your data. For the example, we sort the data from largest to smallest value. As you sort the data, your bar graph should change to reflect the sorting oder.

4. __Sort the axes -- Lose the axis line__  
Navitage to "Chart Tools" and click on the "Layout" tab. Now, navigate to the top-left hand side of the page and select vertical axis from the drop down menu.

Click on the "Format Selection" button.
We want to modify the axis options.

Specifically, we will check the box "Categories in reverse order". This will move the largest value to the top of the graph.
Within the same menu, navigate to the Line Color option and check the No line radio button. This will remove the y-axis line.
