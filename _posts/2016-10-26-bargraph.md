title: Bar Graphs in Excel

### Description
[Bar Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map) are an effective visualization for comparing values across groups or categories. Bar graphs present grouped data as rectangular bars, where the length of each bar is proportional to the underlying data. In the tutorial below, we will demonstrate how to create a sorted bar graph.

### Example

### Encoding
**x**: categorical

**y**: numeric

**color** (fill): numeric or categorical

### How does the data need to be formatted?  
A simple data table is necessary for a bar graph. Data can be in a long or wide format.

### Excel version
Excel 2010 for Windows

### Instructions  

1. Highlight the cell values that you wish to graph.

2. On the Excel ribbon, navigate to the ```Insert``` tab, click on any of the graph types and select the ```All charts Types``` option at the bottom of the pop-up. This will launch a new window with all of the graphing options. Select the bar graph option from the "Insert Chart" menu.

   After clicking OK, you will see a bar graph appear in your workbook.

3. __Sort that data__: Sorting your data not only makes your graphic look nice, it also encourages the reader to make comparisons. In this example, we will sort our data from the largest to smallest value using Excel's sort option. To sort your data, navigate to the ```Home``` tab on the ribbon and select the custom sort option from the drop down menu.

  Select your desired columns over which you would like to sort your data. For the example, we sort the data from largest to smallest     value. As you sort the data, your bar graph should change to reflect the sorting oder.

  While the data are sorted, the largest value actually appears at the bottom of the graph. We will fix this in the next step (or you could resort your data from smallest to largest).

4. __Resort the axes, lose the y-axis tick marks__: Navitage to ```Chart Tools``` and click on the ```Layout``` tab. Now, go to the top lefthand side of the page and select "Vertical (Category) Axis" from the drop down menu located directly underneath the ```File``` option at the top of the ribbon.   
  ![image1]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/Bar_vert_axis.png "Chart Tools: Format Selection Menu")
  Click the ```Format Selection``` button. This will launch a new pop-up window. Click on "Axis Options".  
  ![image1]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/02_Bar_graph_reverse_axes.PNG "Chart Tools: Format Selection Menu")  
  Check the box "Categories in reverse order". This will move the largest value to the top of the graph.   
  From the same menu, navigate to the ```Line Color``` option and check the "No line" radio button. This will remove the ticks on the y-axis.

5. __Move x-axis labels from top to bottom__: While it's nice to have a label on the x-axis, in this case it is a bit distracting (see [chart junk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartjunk)). We are going to move the labels from the top to the bottom. At the top left of the screen, navigate the menu to "Horizontal (Value) Axis". Click ```Format Selection```.  
  ![image1]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/03_Bar_graph_x_axis.PNG "Chart Tools: Format Selection Menu")  
  Under the "Axes Options" tab, find the box that reads "Axis labels: Next to Axis". Click on the dropdown and select "High". This will move the axis to the bottom. To remove the x-axis, click on the "Line Color" option. Check the radio button next to the "No Line" option.

6. __Increase the bar width__: To increase the weight/width of the bars, click on ```Chart Tools --> Layout``` menu. Select the "Series (name of variable)" option from the top left-hand side. Click on the ```Format Selection``` button. 
  ![image1]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/04_Bar_graph_format_data_series.PNG "Chart Tools: Format Selection Menu")  
  The Format Data Series menu box will pop up. With the "Series Options" selected, move your cursor to the Gap Width slider. Move the  slider to 25% or manually type the value in. This will decrease the gap width between the bars.

7. __Change the bar color__: From the same menu, click on the "Fill" option on the left hand size. Select the "Solid Fill" radio button and click on the Color menu. Select more colors at the bottom of the menu. We will use the Red-Green-Blue values from [ColorBrewer 2.0](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) to help us pick a gray. Change the Red, Green and Blue values all to be 200. Click ok. This will change all your bars to a medium shade of gray. 
  If you would like to change the color of a single bar, click on any of the bars to select them all. Then, left-click on the bar you wish to modify. This will isolate the election to a single bar. Repeat the above steps to add a meaningful splash of color.

8. __Drop the legend__: Legends are often distracting and can force the reader to work. Readers are lazy, make it easy on them by directly labeling and annotating your graphs. Click on the legend in the graph. Once it is highlighted, press the delete key. 

9. __Directly label and change number formatting__: From the ```Chart Tools --> Layout --> Data Labels``` menu, select the inside end option to add data labels. 
  ![image1]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/05_Data_labels.PNG "Add data labels")  
  Now, navigate back to the chart layers menu at the top left and click on the "Series (your variable) Data Labels" dropdown. Click ```Format Selection```. 
  ![image1]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/06_Formate_direct_labels.PNG "Format data labels")   
  Navigate to the Number option and under "Category:" select Number. Set the decimal places to be 0. Hover over the data labels on your graph and left click to highlight them, then right click. From the formatting window change the font color to be white, or use the more color options to change the RGB values to 0, 0, 0.

10. __Formatting the Horizontal Axis Major Gridlines__: Navigate to "Chart Tools" and click on the "Layout" tab. Go to the top-left hand side of the page and select "Horizontal (Value) Axis Major Gridlines" from the drop down menu. Click format selection. Click on the line color option. Change the line color to be the same as the bars. Next, click on line style. Change the dash type to the second option (round dot).

11. __Change the font and color on the text__: Select the y-axis values. Right click. Change the font color to a medium shade of gray (127, 127, 127). Repeat the same process with the chart title. Click and drag the chart title to the left hand side. Insert a meaningful title for your bar graph. 
  Congratulations, you have just made a nice looking bar graph.

12. __Save the chart as a template__: If you would like to save the completed bar graph as a template, navigate to "Chart Tools --> Design" and locate the ```Save As Template``` button at the top left. Click on the button, give your template a name, and click OK.
  ![image1]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/07_Save_as_template.PNG "Format data labels")
  To apply your template, highlight the data you would like to graph. Click ```Insert``` and select any chart type and select the "All Chart Types" option. Inside the window with all graphing options, click on the "Templates" folder at the top. This will contain the template you just saved. Apply it to your data.
