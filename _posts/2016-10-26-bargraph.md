title: Bar Graphs in Excel

### Description
[Bar Graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map) are an effective visualization for comparing values across groups or categories. Bar graphs present grouped data as rectangular bars, where the length of each bar is proportion to the underlying data. In the tutorial below, we will demonstrate how to create a rotated, sorted bar graph.

### Example

### Encoding
**x**: categorical

**y**: numeric

**color** (fill): numeric or categorical

### How does the data need to be formatted?  
A simple data table is necessary for a bar graph. Data can be in a long or wide format in Excel.

### Excel version
Excel 2010 for Windows

### Instructions  

1. Highlight the cell values that you wish to graph.

2. On the Excel ribbon, navigate to the ```Insert``` tab and select the ```See all charts``` option. This will launch a new window with all of the graphing options. Select the bar graph option from the Insert Chart menu.

3. __Sort that data__: Sorting your data not only makes your graphic look nice, it also encourages the reader to make comparisons. In this example, we will sort our data from the largest to smallest value using Excel's sort option. To sort your data, navigate to the ```Home``` tab on the ribbon and select the custom sort option from the drop down menu.

Select your desired columns over which you would like to sort your data. For the example, we sort the data from largest to smallest value. As you sort the data, your bar graph should change to reflect the sorting oder.

4. __Sort the axes, lose the axis line__: Navitage to ```Chart Tools``` and click on the ```Layout``` tab. Now, go to the top lefthand side of the page and select "vertical axis" from the drop down menu.   ![image1]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/03_Bar_graph_x_axis.PNG "Chart Tools: Format Selection Menu")<br>  Click on the ```Format Selection``` button. This should launche a new pop-up window. We want to modify the axis options. ![image1]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/02_Bar_graph_reverse_axes.PNG "Chart Tools: Format Selection Menu")  Specifically, check the box "Categories in reverse order". This will move the largest value to the top of the graph. From the same menu, navigate to the ```Line Color``` option and check the "No line" radio button. This will remove the y-axis.

5. __Move x-axis from top to bottom__: While it's nice to have a x-axis, in this case it is a bit distracting (see [chart junk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartjunk)). We are going to move the x-axis from the top to the bottom. At the top left of the screen, navigate the menu to "Horizontal (Value) Axis". Click Format Selection. Under the Axes Options tab, find the box that reads "Axis labels: Next to Axis". Click on the triangle and select "High". This will move the axis to the bottom. 

6. __Increase the bar width__: To increase the weight/width of the bars, use the Chart Tools --> Layout menu to bring up the menu window at the top left again. Select the "Series (name of variable)" option and click on the Format Selection button. The Format Data Series menu box will pop up. With the Serioes Options selected, move your cursor to the Gap Width slider. Move the slider to 25% or manually type the value in. This will decrease the gap width between the bars.

7. __Change the bar color__: From the same menu, click on the "Fill" option on the left hand size. Select the ```Solid Fill``` radio button and click on the Color menu. Select more colors at the bottom of the menu. We will use the RGB values from [ColorBrewer 2.0](http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3) to help us pick a gray. Change the Red, Green and Blue values all to be 200. Click ok. This will change all your bars to a medium shade of gray.

8. __Drop the legend__: Legends are often distracting and can force the reader to work. Reader's are lazy, make it easy on them by directly labeling and annotating your graphs. Click on the legend in the graph. Once it is highlighted, press the delete key. 

9. __Directly label and change number formatting__: Using the Chart Tools --> Layout --> Data Labels menu, select the inside end option to add data labels. Now, navigate back to the chart layers menu at the top left and click on the "Series (your variable" Data Labels" dropdown. Click Format Selection. Navigate to the Number option and selection Number under the number category. Set the decimal places to be 0. Hover over the data labels on your graph and left click to highlight them, then right click. From the formatting window change the font color to be white or use the more color options to change the RGB values to 0, 0, 0.

10. __Formatting the Horizontal Axis Major Gridlines__: Navitage to "Chart Tools" and click on the "Layout" tab. Now, navigate to the top-left hand side of the page and select Horizontal (Value) Axis Major Gridlines from the drop down menu. Click format selection. Change the line color to be a solid line. Change the line color to be the same as the bars. Next, click on line style. Change the dash type to the second option (round dot).

11. __Change the font and color on the text__: Select the y-axis values. Right click. Change the font color to a medium shade of gray (127, 127, 127). Repeat the same process with the chart title. Click and drag the chart title to the left hand side. Insert a meaningful title for your bar graph.
